- 👋 Hi, I’m @HyperBike77
- 👀 I’m interested in Web development (front and back-end) and software design and engineering including Android programming as well as some game development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web design. I feel I have a decent understanding of the basics of html and css. I'm currently dipping more into Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects as well as anything including javascript to help boost my knowledge and confidence in web development and programming in general.
- 📫 How to reach me I can best be reached at my email address damian_metal61790@yahoo.com
